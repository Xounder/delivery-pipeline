# Session Save Skill

## When to use

Use this skill at the end of the STOP hook, after `learning-improvement` and `continuous-learning`. It is the **third and last** of 3 skills in the chain. See `learning-improvement/SKILL.md` for the full chain description.

## Workflow

1. **Receive evaluation** — use the output of the `learning-improvement` skill (evaluation with DONE, WRONG, IMPROV, LEARN, NEXT)
2. **Call the `save-session` custom tool** — the tool is defined at `.opencode/tools/save-session.ts` and runs via Bun/Node (not shell):
   ```json
   {
     "evaluation": "DONE: ...\nWRONG: ...\nIMPROV: ...\nLEARN: ...\nNEXT: ...",
     "description": "brief-description"
   }
   ```
   The tool:
   - Creates file in `.opencode/sessions/` with format: `YYYYMMDD-HH-MM-description-session.tmp`
   - Keeps only the 2 most recent session files (newly created + previous one)
   - Deletes older session files automatically
3. **Content** — same as the received evaluation, 5-7 lines in English, each section starting with an uppercase label followed by `:`

## Expected output

- File `.opencode/sessions/YYYYMMDD-HH-MM-description-session.tmp` created
- Only 2 session files retained in the directory

## Rules

- Do not modify the received evaluation
- Do not propose changes to docs (this is the responsibility of `continuous-learning`)
- Only save the file and report to the user
- Use the `save-session` custom tool for consistent behavior

## Chain position

This is the **LAST** (3rd) skill in the STOP chain: `learning-improvement` → `continuous-learning` → **`session-save`**. After saving, the chain is complete — report to the user and stop. Do not load any further skills.

## Tool Reference

**Tool location**: `.opencode/tools/save-session.ts` (custom tool, runs via Bun/Node)

**Usage** (called automatically by opencode):
```json
{
  "evaluation": "DONE: ...\nWRONG: ...\nIMPROV: ...\nLEARN: ...\nNEXT: ...",
  "description": "doc-audit"
}
```
